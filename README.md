## Description

This project is a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from the user's input using the inquirer package. This README.md that is generated includes a functional table of contents, a licensing badge from shields.io, and links to the user's github profile and email. In fact, this very README.md was generated using the command line application.
